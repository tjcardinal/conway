# conway

Conway's Game of Life implemented in different languages

# General structure for implementations:

- Cells are represented as a tuple of x,y integer coordinates
- Cells are stored as a set (i.e. container of unique values) where existence in the set indicates a live cell
- The next iteration of the set is generated by the following steps using the current set:
    1. Get the cells to check (the ones that can change state):
        - Find the 8 neighbors of each current cell (these are the only ones that may become alive)
        - Take the union of the current cells and all the neighbors
    2. For each cell to check, include it in the next set only if one of the following is true:
        - There are 3 of its neighbors in the current set (it becomes alive)
        - There are 2 of its neighbors in the current set and it is in the current set (it survives)
